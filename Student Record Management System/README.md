# 🎓 Student Record Management System

A **C++ CLI-based project** for managing student academic records using file handling, OOP, and terminal color output. This system allows you to:

- Add new student records
- View all saved records
- Delete records by student ID
- Store and retrieve data from a binary file (`students.dat`)
